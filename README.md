# State-Level-Agriculture-Census-Crop
The objectives include understanding factors affecting crop yields, identifying high-performing and underperforming states, and generating actionable insights to improve agricultural output and resource allocation across regions.

**DATA SOURCES**

Source Description and Timeline : Indian Data Portal/ISB Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Dataset

Time Period : 2011 & 2016

Domain : Food & Agricultural

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

To analyse the forecast for the future year of crop production and gain the crop yield

To analyse Year-over-year growth or decline in crop production

To analyse Long-term trends in cultivated area, productivity, or output

To Compare performance before and after certain years or policies (if time series is present)

**INSIGHTS
DESCRIPTIVE**

  It shows the total area of 447.51M all over the State
  
  Compare which state has the most farm land
  
  Uttar Pradesh state has the highest farm land
  
  And 2nd highest farm land has Rajasthan State
  
  See which crop occupies the Largest Area 
  
**DIAGNOSIS**
  Identify which crop area are Increased or Decreased
  
  Kerala state grows the crop most.
  
  Its shows Increased or Decreased in Previous Year.
    
**PREDICTIVE**
  The Cultivated area has shown a gradual decline in recent years.
  
  The forecast predicts a further drop, highlighting a need for better land management
  
  The cultivated area shows irregular variations across years.
  
  Forecast suggests moderate stability with small future changes.
    
**PRESCRIPTIVE**
  The map visual shows the total cultivated area across different locations.
  
  Larger bubbles indicate regions with higher land utilization for agriculture.
  
  The KPI compares the actual cultivated area with the target area (if the KPI value is above the target, agricultural goals are being achieved.)
  

**CONCLUSION**

The agricultural census dataset provides comprehensive insights into India’s crop production patterns across states and farm size categories. Analysis of irrigated and unirrigated areas reveals significant disparities between regions—states with better irrigation infrastructure consistently report higher productivity and larger cropped areas. Major crops such as paddy, wheat, maize, and pulses dominate total cultivated area, reflecting India’s staple food preferences

State-level comparisons indicate that regions like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab contribute a substantial portion of the country’s total cultivated land. Coastal and northeastern states show smaller agricultural footprints but exhibit diverse crop types.


In summary, the dataset underscores the importance of irrigation infrastructure, landholding size, and crop diversification in shaping agricultural outcomes across India. These insights can guide policymakers in designing more targeted agricultural and irrigation development programs to improve productivity and sustainability.
